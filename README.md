## Introduction

### **Who is Olist?**

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized sellers to large online marketplaces, enabling them to sell their products across Brazil. It provides tools for order management, logistics, payments, and customer support, helping sellers reach more customers and scale their online business.

### **Project Goal**

**Olist Marketplace:** Why First-Time Buyers Don't Come Back. **(96.9%)** of customers never make a second purchase.


**The core question:** Are customers leaving because of Olist's operational problems, or is this just how Brazilian
e-commerce works?   
**If it's operational,** you need to:
1. Isolate the biggest controllable factor (delivery issues, seller quality, product problems)     
2. Prove it's actually causing churn, not just correlated with it     
3. Estimate what fixing it would be worth
            
**If it's structural** (people only buy certain categories once, trust issues with online shopping), you need to say that clearly so they stop trying to fix retention and focus on acquisition efficiency instead.
